   Your company has users who work remotely from laptops.
   <br/>
   You plan to move some of the applications accessed by the remote users to Azure virtual machines. The users will access the applications in Azure by using a point-to-site VPN connection. You will use certificates generated from an on-premises-based Certification authority (CA).
   <br/>
   You need to recommend which certificates are required for the deployment.
   <br/>
   What should you include in the recommendation? To answer, drag the appropriate certificates to the correct targets. Each certificate may be used once, more than once, of not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

    Microsoft identity platform is an evolution of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) developer platform. It allows developers to build applications that sign in all
    <br/>
    Microsoft identities and get tokens to call Microsoft APIs, such as Microsoft Graph, or APIs that developers have built. The Microsoft identity platform consists of:
    <br/>
    OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant authentication service that enables developers to authenticate any Microsoft identity, including:
    <br/>
    Work or school accounts (provisioned through Azure AD)
    <br/>
    Personal Microsoft accounts (such as Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com)
    <br/>
    Social or local accounts (via Azure AD B2C)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Azure AD B2C tenant -
    <br/>
    Azure Active Directory B2C provides business-to-customer identity as a service. Your customers use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications and APIs.
    <br/>
    Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) integrates directly with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication so that you can add a second layer of security to sign-up and sign-in experiences in your applications.

    Step 1: Azure AD Application proxy
    <br/>
    Azure AD Application Proxy is a prerequisite for a scenario with an on-premises legacy applications published for cloud access,
    <br/>
    Note: Application Proxy is a feature of Azure AD that enables users to access on-premises web applications from a remote client. Application Proxy includes both the Application Proxy service which runs in the cloud, and the Application Proxy connector which runs on an on-premises server.
    <br/>
    Step 2: an Azure AD managed identity
    <br/>
    Microsoft's identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities. These solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. We call this hybrid identity.
    <br/>
    Step 3: an Azure AD conditional access policy
    <br/>
    Conditional Access is the tool used by Azure Active Directory to bring signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. Conditional Access is at the heart of the new identity driven control plane.
    <br/>
    With hybrid identity to Azure AD and hybrid identity management these scenarios become possible.

   The network contains an Active Directory forest named Litware.com that is linked to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named Litware.com. All users have Azure Active Directory Premium P2 licenses.
   <br/>
   Litware has a second Azure AD tenant named dev.Litware.com that is used as a development environment.
   <br/>
   The Litware.com tenant has a conditional acׁess policy named capolicy1. Capolicy1 requires that when users manage the Azure subscription for a production environment by using the Azure portal, they must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Azure Environment
   <br/>
   Litware has 10 Azure subscriptions that are linked to the Litware.com tenant and five Azure subscriptions that are linked to the dev.Litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an Enterprise Agreement (EA).
   <br/>
   The Litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. On-premises Environment
   <br/>
   The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table.

   <br/>
   Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure.
   <br/>
   Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts.
   <br/>
   Planned Changes and Requirements. Authentication and Authorization Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
   <br/>
   Users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using Azure
   <br/>
   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   <br/>
   The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permission to all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0002800006.png"/>
   <br/>
   To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that will host the app.
   <br/>
   Role1 must be used to assign permissions to the storage accounts of all the Azure subscriptions.
   <br/>
   RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible.
   <br/>
   Planned Changes and Requirements. Resiliency Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
   <br/>
   Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
   <br/>
   - Fail over automatically.
   <br/>
   - Minimize I/O latency.
   <br/>
   App1 must meet the following requirements:
   <br/>
   - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
   <br/>
   - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
   <br/>
   - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
   <br/>
   Planned Changes and Requirements. Security and Compliance Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
   <br/>
   Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years.
   <br/>
   On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1.
   <br/>
   Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be prevented.
   <br/>
   All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled.
   <br/>
   App1 must not share physical hardware with other workloads.
   <br/>
   Planned Changes and Requirements. Business Requirements
   <br/>
   Litware identifies the following business requirements:
   <br/>
   Minimize administrative effort.

    Scenario: All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled.
    <br/>
    Step 1: Create an Azure policy definition that uses the deployIfNotExists identity.
    <br/>
    The first step is to define the roles that deployIfNotExists and modify needs in the policy definition to successfully deploy the content of your included template.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Create an Azure policy assignment
    <br/>
    When creating an assignment using the portal, Azure Policy both generates the managed identity and grants it the roles defined in roleDefinitionIds.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Invoke a remediation task
    <br/>
    Resources that are non-compliant to a deployIfNotExists or modify policy can be put into a compliant state through Remediation. Remediation is accomplished by instructing Azure Policy to run the deployIfNotExists effect or the modify operations of the assigned policy on your existing resources and subscriptions, whether that assignment is to a management group, a subscription, a resource group, or an individual resource.
    <br/>
    During evaluation, the policy assignment with deployIfNotExists or modify effects determines if there are non-compliant resources or subscriptions. When non- compliant resources or subscriptions are found, the details are provided on the Remediation page.
