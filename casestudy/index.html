    Box 1: The Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator
    <br/>
    The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator estimates the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.
    <br/>
    Note: The TCO Calculator recommends a set of equivalent services in Azure that will support your applications. Our analysis will show each cost area with an estimate of your on-premises spend versus your spend in Azure. There are several cost categories that either decrease or go away completely when you move workloads to the cloud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Azure Hybrid Benefit -
    <br/>
    Azure Hybrid Benefit is a licensing benefit that helps you to significantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud. It works by letting you use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure. And now, this benefit applies to RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions, too.

    Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authorizes access rights to secured resources through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). Azure Storage defines a set of Azure built-in roles that encompass common sets of permissions used to access blob data.
    <br/>
    When an Azure role is assigned to an Azure AD security principal, Azure grants access to those resources for that security principal. An Azure AD security principal may be a user, a group, an application service principal, or a managed identity for Azure resources.
    <br/>
    Scenario:
    <br/>
    To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that will host the app.
    <br/>
    The Litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage.
    <br/>
    Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
    <br/>
    ✑ On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1.

    By default, Azure service resources secured to virtual networks aren't reachable from on-premises networks. If you want to allow traffic from on-premises, you must also allow public (typically, NAT) IP addresses from your on-premises or ExpressRoute. You can add these IP addresses through the IP firewall configuration for Azure service resources.

    Scenario: All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled.
    <br/>
    Step 1: Create an Azure policy definition that uses the deployIfNotExists identity.
    <br/>
    The first step is to define the roles that deployIfNotExists and modify needs in the policy definition to successfully deploy the content of your included template.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Create an Azure policy assignment
    <br/>
    When creating an assignment using the portal, Azure Policy both generates the managed identity and grants it the roles defined in roleDefinitionIds.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Invoke a remediation task
    <br/>
    Resources that are non-compliant to a deployIfNotExists or modify policy can be put into a compliant state through Remediation. Remediation is accomplished by instructing Azure Policy to run the deployIfNotExists effect or the modify operations of the assigned policy on your existing resources and subscriptions, whether that assignment is to a management group, a subscription, a resource group, or an individual resource.
    <br/>
    During evaluation, the policy assignment with deployIfNotExists or modify effects determines if there are non-compliant resources or subscriptions. When non- compliant resources or subscriptions are found, the details are provided on the Remediation page.

   <br/>
   An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
   <br/>
   The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
   <br/>
   Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Problem Statements
   <br/>

   <br/>
   Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service.
   <br/>
   An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services.
   <br/>
   Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Database Requirements
   <br/>
   Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:
   <br/>
   Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings.
   <br/>
   To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0004000010.png"/>

   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Contoso, Ltd, is a US-based financial services company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Payment Processing System
   <br/>
   Contoso hosts a business-critical payment processing system in its New York data center. The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.
   <br/>
   The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.
   <br/>
   The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
   <br/>
   Agent jobs.
   <br/>
   The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
   <br/>
   The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
   <br/>
   Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
   <br/>
   Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
   <br/>
   Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.
   <br/>
   Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0018900004.png"/>
   <br/>
   Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
   <br/>
   Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
   <br/>
   Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Historical Transaction Query System
   <br/>
   Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in
   <br/>
   Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.
   <br/>
   The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Current Issues
   <br/>
   The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, as the queries frequently cause table scans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements. Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
   <br/>
   Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.
   <br/>
   Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Migration Requirements
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:
   <br/>
   Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:
   <br/>
   If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.
   <br/>
   Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availability.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.
   <br/>
   Payment processing system must be able to use grouping and joining tables on encrypted columns.
   <br/>
   Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.
   <br/>

   Minimize the use of on-premises infrastructure services.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the .NET web service querying Azure Cosmos DB.
   <br/>
   Minimize the frequency of table scans.
   <br/>
   If a region fails, ensure that the historical transaction query system remains available without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Information Security Requirements
   <br/>
   The IT security team wants to ensure that identity management is performed by using Active Directory. Password hashes must be stored on-premises only.
   <br/>
   Access to all business-critical systems must rely on Active Directory credentials. Any suspicious authentication attempts must trigger a multi-factor authentication prompt automatically.

   Overview -
   <br/>
   Contoso, Ltd, is a US-based financial services company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Payment Processing System
   <br/>
   Contoso hosts a business-critical payment processing system in its New York data center. The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.
   <br/>
   The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.
   <br/>
   The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
   <br/>
   Agent jobs.
   <br/>
   The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
   <br/>
   The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
   <br/>
   Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
   <br/>
   Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
   <br/>
   Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.
   <br/>
   Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0023600004.png"/>
   <br/>
   Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
   <br/>
   Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
   <br/>
   Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Historical Transaction Query System
   <br/>
   Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in
   <br/>
   Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.
   <br/>
   The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Current Issues
   <br/>
   The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, as the queries frequently cause table scans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements. Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
   <br/>
   Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.
   <br/>
   Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Migration Requirements
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:
   <br/>
   Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:
   <br/>
   If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.
   <br/>
   Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availability.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.
   <br/>
   Payment processing system must be able to use grouping and joining tables on encrypted columns.
   <br/>
   Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Contoso, Ltd, is a US-based financial services company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Payment Processing System
   <br/>
   Contoso hosts a business-critical payment processing system in its New York data center. The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.
   <br/>
   The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.
   <br/>
   The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
   <br/>
   Agent jobs.
   <br/>
   The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
   <br/>
   The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
   <br/>
   Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
   <br/>
   Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
   <br/>
   Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.
   <br/>
   Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0023600004.png"/>
   <br/>
   Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
   <br/>
   Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
   <br/>
   Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Historical Transaction Query System
   <br/>
   Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in
   <br/>
   Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.
   <br/>
   The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Current Issues
   <br/>
   The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, as the queries frequently cause table scans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements. Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
   <br/>
   Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.
   <br/>
   Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Migration Requirements
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:
   <br/>
   Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:
   <br/>
   If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.
   <br/>
   Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availability.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.
   <br/>
   Payment processing system must be able to use grouping and joining tables on encrypted columns.
   <br/>
   Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0023700014.png"/>
   <br/>
   Host the middle tier of the payment processing system on a virtual machine
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for the historical transaction query system:
   <br/>
   Minimize the use of on-premises infrastructure services.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the .NET web service querying Azure Cosmos DB.
   <br/>
   Minimize the frequency of table scans.
   <br/>
   If a region fails, ensure that the historical transaction query system remains available without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Information Security Requirements
   <br/>
   The IT security team wants to ensure that identity management is performed by using Active Directory. Password hashes must be stored on-premises only.
   <br/>
   Access to all business-critical systems must rely on Active Directory credentials. Any suspicious authentication attempts must trigger a multi-factor authentication prompt automatically.
   <span class="inquestion-subtitle mb-0 mt-3">

    Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.
    <br/>
    Traffic Manager uses DNS to direct client requests to the most appropriate service endpoint based on a traffic-routing method and the health of the endpoints. An endpoint is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Traffic Manager provides a range of traffic-routing methods and endpoint monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover models. Traffic Manager is resilient to failure, including the failure of an entire Azure region.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Yes -
    <br/>
    Recent changes in Azure brought some significant changes in autoscaling options for Azure Web Apps (i.e. Azure App Service to be precise as scaling happens on App Service plan level and has effect on all Web Apps running in that App Service plan).

    Box 1: 3 -
    <br/>
    Scenario: App1 must meet the following requirements:
    <br/>
    ✑ Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
    <br/>
    ✑ Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
    <br/>
    A host group is a resource that represents a collection of dedicated hosts. You create a host group in a region and an availability zone, and add hosts to it.
    <br/>
    Use Availability Zones for fault isolation
    <br/>
    Availability zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. A host group is created in a single availability zone. Once created, all hosts will be placed within that zone. To achieve high availability across zones, you need to create multiple host groups (one per zone) and spread your hosts accordingly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: 1 -
    <br/>
    Scenario: App1 must meet the following requirements:
    <br/>
    ✑ Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
    <br/>
    An Azure virtual machine scale set can automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances that run your application. This automated and elastic behavior reduces the management overhead to monitor and optimize the performance of your application.

   Overview -
   <br/>
   Contoso, Ltd, is a US-based financial services company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Payment Processing System
   <br/>
   Contoso hosts a business-critical payment processing system in its New York data center. The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.
   <br/>
   The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.
   <br/>
   The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
   <br/>
   Agent jobs.
   <br/>
   The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
   <br/>
   The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
   <br/>
   Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
   <br/>
   Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
   <br/>
   Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.
   <br/>
   Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0031900004.png"/>
   <br/>
   Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
   <br/>
   Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
   <br/>
   Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Historical Transaction Query System
   <br/>
   Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in
   <br/>
   Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.
   <br/>
   The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.
   <br/>
   Existing Environment. Current Issues
   <br/>
   The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, as the queries frequently cause table scans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements. Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
   <br/>
   Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.
   <br/>
   Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Migration Requirements
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:
   <br/>
   Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.
   <br/>
   Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:
   <br/>
   If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.
   <br/>
   Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availabilty.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.
   <br/>
   Payment processing system must be able to use grouping and joining tables on encrypted columns.
   <br/>
   Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04027/0032000014.png"/>
   <br/>
   Host the middle tier of the payment processing system on a virtual machine
   <br/>
   Contoso identifies the following requirements for the historical transaction query system:
   <br/>
   Minimize the use of on-premises infrastructure services.
   <br/>
   Minimize the effort required to modify the .NET web service querying Azure Cosmos DB.
   <br/>
   Minimize the frequency of table scans.
   <br/>
   If a region fails, ensure that the historical transaction query system remains available without any administrative intervention.
   <br/>
   Requirements. Information Security Requirements
   <br/>
   The IT security team wants to ensure that identity management is performed by using Active Directory. Password hashes must be stored on-premises only.
   <br/>
   Access to all business-critical systems must rely on Active Directory credentials. Any suspicious authentication attempts must trigger a multi-factor authentication prompt automatically.
