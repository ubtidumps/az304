                    You have an Azure subscription that contains a custom application named Application1. Application1
                    was developed by an external company named Fabrikam,
                    <br />
                    Ltd. Developers at Fabrikam were assigned role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to the
                    Application1 components. All users are licensed for the
                    <br />
                    Microsoft 365 E5 plan.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution to verify whether the Fabrikam developers still require permissions
                    to Application1. The solution must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë To the manager of the developers, send a monthly email message that lists the access permissions
                    to Application1.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë If the manager does not verify an access permission, automatically revoke that permission.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Minimize development effort.
                    <br />

                        Shared Access Signatures (SAS) allows for limited-time fine grained access control to resources.
                        So you can generate URL, specify duration (for month of April) and disseminate URL to 10 team
                        members. On May 1, the SAS token is automatically invalidated, denying team members continued
                        access.

                    You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that syncs with an on-premises Active Directory
                    domain.
                    <br />
                    You have an internal web app named WebApp1 that is hosted on-premises. WebApp1 uses Integrated
                    Windows authentication.
                    <br />
                    Some users work remotely and do NOT have VPN access to the on-premises network.
                    <br />
                    You need to provide the remote users with single sign-on (SSO) access to WebApp1.
                    <br />
                    Which two features should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the

                        A: Application Proxy is a feature of Azure AD that enables users to access on-premises web
                        applications from a remote client. Application Proxy includes both the
                        <br />
                        Application Proxy service which runs in the cloud, and the Application Proxy connector which
                        runs on an on-premises server.
                        <br />
                        You can configure single sign-on to an Application Proxy application.
                        <br />
                        C: Microsoft recommends using Application Proxy with pre-authentication and Conditional Access
                        policies for remote access from the internet. An approach to provide Conditional Access for
                        intranet use is to modernize applications so they can directly authenticate with AAD.

                    You plan to deploy Azure Databricks to support a machine learning application. Data engineers will
                    mount an Azure Data Lake Storage account to the Databricks file system. Permissions to folders are
                    granted directly to the data engineers.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a design for the planned Databrick deployment. The solution must meet the
                    following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Ensure that the data engineers can only access folders to which they have permissions.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Minimize development effort.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Minimize costs.
                    <br />

                    You plan to deploy an Azure web app named App1 that will use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
                    authentication.
                    <br />
                    App1 will be accessed from the internet by the users at your company. All the users have computers
                    that run Windows 10 and are joined to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution to ensure that the users can connect to App1 without being prompted
                    for authentication and can access App1 only from company-owned computers.

                        Box 1: An Azure AD app registration
                        <br />
                        Azure active directory (AD) provides cloud based directory and identity management services.You
                        can use azure AD to manage users of your application and authenticate access to your
                        applications using azure active directory.
                        <br />
                        You register your application with Azure active directory tenant.

                        Box 2: A conditional access policy
                        <br />
                        Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements, if a user wants to access
                        a resource, then they must complete an action.
                        <br />
                        By using Conditional Access policies, you can apply the right access controls when needed to
                        keep your organization secure and stay out of your user's way when not needed.

                    Your company deploys several virtual machines on-premises and to Azure. ExpressRoute is deployed and
                    configured for on-premises to Azure connectivity.
                    <br />
                    Several virtual machines exhibit network connectivity issues.
                    <br />
                    You need to analyze the network traffic to identify whether packets are being allowed or denied to
                    the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Solution: Use Azure Network Watcher to run IP flow verify to analyze the network traffic.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                        Azure Network Watcher IP Flow Verify allows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a VM
                        level.
                        <br />
                        IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The
                        information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port.
                        If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is
                        returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,
                        <br />
                        IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet
                        and from or to the on-premises environment.

                        Activity logs are kept for 90 days. You can query for any range of dates, as long as the
                        starting date isn't more than 90 days in the past.
                        <br />

                    You have 100 servers that run Windows Server 2012 R2 and host Microsoft SQL Server 2014 instances.
                    The instances host databases that have the following characteristics:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Stored procedures are implemented by using CLR.
                    <br />

                    You plan to move all the data from SQL Server to Azure.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a service to host the databases. The solution must meet the following
                    requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Whenever possible, minimize management overhead for the migrated databases.
                    <br />

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains two applications named App1 and App2. App1 is a sales
                    processing application. When a transaction in App1 requires shipping, a message is added to an Azure
                    Storage account queue, and then App2 listens to the queue for relevant transactions.
                    <br />
                    In the future, additional applications will be added that will process some of the shipping requests
                    based on the specific details of the transactions.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a replacement for the storage account queue to ensure that each additional
                    application will be able to read the relevant transactions.
                    <br />
                    What should you recommend?

                        A queue allows processing of a message by a single consumer. In contrast to queues, topics and
                        subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication in a publish and subscribe pattern.
                        It's useful for scaling to large numbers of recipients. Each published message is made available
                        to each subscription registered with the topic. Publisher sends a message to a topic and one or
                        more subscribers receive a copy of the message, depending on filter rules set on these
                        subscriptions.

                    ‚úë Maximize data throughput.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Prevent the modification of data for one year.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Minimize latency for read and write operations.

                        <br />
                        Block Blob is a premium storage account type for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for
                        scenarios with high transactions rates, or scenarios that use smaller objects or require
                        consistently low storage latency.

                        Box 2: Blob -
                        <br />
                        The Archive tier is an offline tier for storing blob data that is rarely accessed. The Archive
                        tier offers the lowest storage costs, but higher data retrieval costs and latency compared to
                        the online tiers (Hot and Cool). Data must remain in the Archive tier for at least 180 days or
                        be subject to an early deletion charge.

                    You are designing an application that will be hosted in Azure.

                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a database platform to host the databases. The solution must meet the

                    ‚úë The solution must meet a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99% uptime.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë The compute resources allocated to the databases must scale dynamically.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë The solution must have reserved capacity.
                    <br />
                    Compute charges must be minimized.

                        Active geo-replication is a feature that lets you to create a continuously synchronized readable
                        secondary database for a primary database. The readable secondary database may be in the same
                        Azure region as the primary, or, more commonly, in a different region. This kind of readable
                        secondary databases are also known as geo-secondaries, or geo-replicas.

                    You are planning an Azure IoT Hub solution that will include 50,000 IoT devices.
                    <br />
                    Each device will stream data, including temperature, device ID, and time data. Approximately 50,000
                    records will be written every second. The data will be visualized in near real time.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a service to store and query the data.
                    <br />
                    Which two services can you recommend? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

                        B: Too slow.
                        <br />
                        C: Always On availability group RPO: Because replication to the secondary replica is
                        asynchronous, there's some data loss.

                    in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might
                    have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.
                    <br />
                    After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result,
                    these questions will not appear in the review screen.
                    <br />
                    You need to deploy resources to host a stateless web app in an Azure subscription. The solution must
                    meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Provide access to the full .NET framework.
                    <br />
                    Provide redundancy if an Azure region fails.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    ‚úë Grant administrators access to the operating system to install custom application dependencies.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You deploy two Azure virtual machines to two Azure regions, and you create an Azure
                    Traffic Manager profile.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                    You need to deploy resources to host a stateless web app in an Azure subscription. The solution must
                    meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Provide access to the full .NET framework.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Provide redundancy if an Azure region fails.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Grant administrators access to the operating system to install custom application dependencies.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You deploy two Azure virtual machines to two Azure regions, and you deploy an Azure
                    Application Gateway.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                    You plan to create an Azure Storage account that will host file shares. The shares will be accessed
                    from on-premises applications that are transaction-intensive.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution to minimize latency when accessing the file shares. The solution
                    must provide the highest-level of resiliency for the selected storage tier.
                    <br />
                    What should you include in the recommendation? To answer, select the appropriate options in the

                        Premium: Premium file shares are backed by solid-state drives (SSDs) and provide consistent high
                        performance and low latency, within single-digit milliseconds for most IO operations, for

                        <br />
                        ‚úë Hot: Hot file shares offer storage optimized for general purpose file sharing scenarios such
                        as team shares. Hot file shares are offered on the standard storage hardware backed by HDDs.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Transaction optimized: Transaction optimized file shares enable transaction heavy workloads
                        that don't need the latency offered by premium file shares.
                        <br />
                        Transaction optimized file shares are offered on the standard storage hardware backed by hard
                        disk drives (HDDs). Transaction optimized has historically been called "standard", however this
                        refers to the storage media type rather than the tier itself (the hot and cool are also
                        "standard" tiers, because they are on standard storage hardware).

                        Premium Azure file shares only support LRS and ZRS.

                    You need to deploy resources to host a stateless web app in an Azure subscription. The solution must
                    meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Provide access to the full .NET framework.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Provide redundancy if an Azure region fails.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Solution: You deploy an Azure virtual machine scale set that uses autoscaling.
                    <br />

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account.
                    <br />
                    An application sometimes writes duplicate files to the storage account.
                    <br />
                    You have a PowerShell script that identifies and deletes duplicate files in the storage account.
                    Currently, the script is run manually after approval from the operations manager.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a serverless solution that performs the following actions:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Runs the script once an hour to identify whether duplicate files exist
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Sends an email notification to the operations manager requesting approval to delete the duplicate
                    files
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Processes an email response from the operations manager specifying whether the deletion was
                    approved
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Runs the script if the deletion was approved
                    <br />
                    What should you include in the recommendation?

                        When you want to run code that performs a specific job in your logic apps, you can create your
                        own function by using Azure Functions. This service helps you create Node.js, C#, and F#
                        functions so you don't have to build a complete app or infrastructure to run code. You can also
                        call logic apps from inside Azure functions.

                    The on-premises Active Directory domain syncs with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
                    <br />
                    Server1 runs an application named App1 that uses LDAP queries to verify user identities in the
                    on-premises Active Directory domain.
                    <br />
                    You plan to migrate Server1 to a virtual machine in Subscription1.
                    <br />
                    A company security policy states that the virtual machines and services deployed to Subscription1
                    must be prevented from accessing the on-premises network.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution to ensure that App1 continues to function after the migration. The
                    solution must meet the security policy.
                    <br />
                    What should you include in the recommendation?

                    You have an on-premises network and an Azure subscription. The on-premises network has several
                    branch offices.
                    <br />
                    A branch office in Toronto contains a virtual machine named VM1 that is configured as a file server.
                    Users access the shared files on VM1 from all the offices.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution to ensure that the users can access the shared files as quickly as
                    possible if the Toronto branch office is inaccessible.
                    <br />
                    What should you include in the recommendation?

                    You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that is linked to a hybrid Azure Active Directory
                    (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    You have an on-premises datacenter that does NOT have a VPN connection to Subscription1. The
                    datacenter contains a computer named Server1 that has
                    <br />
                    Microsoft SQL Server 2016 installed. Server is prevented from accessing the internet.
                    <br />
                    An Azure logic app resource named LogicApp1 requires write access to a database on Server1.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution to provide LogicApp1 with the ability to access Server1.

                    Your company develops a web service that is deployed to an Azure virtual machine named VM1. The web

                    <br />
                    VM1.
                    <br />
                    The current virtual machine deployment is shown in the Deployment exhibit.

                    <br />
                    Testing has shown that the API is accessible from VM1 and VM2. Our partners must be able to connect
                    to the API over the Internet. Partners will use this data in applications that they develop."
                    <br />
                    You deploy an Azure API Management (APIM) service. The relevant API Management configuration is

                    Your company has an existing web app that runs on Azure virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    You need to ensure that the app is protected from SQL injection attempts and uses a layer-7 load
                    balancer. The solution must minimize disruptions to the code of the app.
                    <br />
                    What should you recommend? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct targets. Each
                    service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between
                    panes or scroll to view content.

                    You are designing a microservices architecture that will be hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service
                    (AKS) cluster. Apps that will consume the microservices will be hosted on Azure virtual machines.
                    The virtual machines and the AKS cluster will reside on the same virtual network.
                    <br />
                    You need to design a solution to expose the microservices to the consumer apps. The solution must
                    meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Ingress access to the microservices must be restricted to a single private IP address and
                    protected by using mutual TLS authentication.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë The number of incoming microservice calls must be rate-limited.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Costs must be minimized.
                    <br />
                    What should you include in the solution?

                        One option is to deploy APIM (API Management) inside the cluster VNet.
                        <br />
                        The AKS cluster and the applications that consume the microservices might reside within the same
                        VNet, hence there is no reason to expose the cluster publicly as all API traffic will remain
                        within the VNet. For these scenarios, you can deploy API Management into the cluster VNet. API

                        Firewall policies work across regions and subscriptions.
                        <br />
                        Place all your global configurations in the parent policy.
                        <br />
                        Note: Policies can be created in a hierarchy. You can create a parent/global policy that will
                        contain configurations and rules that will apply to all/a number of firewall instances. Then you
                        create a child policy that inherits from the parent; note that rules changes in the parent
                        instantly appear in the child. The child is associated with a firewall and applies
                        configurations/rules from the parent policy and the child policy instantly to the firewall.

                    App1 and the data are used on the first day of the month only. The data is not expected to grow more

                    <br />
                    The company is rewriting App1 as an Azure web app and plans to migrate all the data to Azure.

                    You are developing a sales application that will contain several Azure cloud services and handle

                    You are designing an Azure App Service web app.
                    <br />
                    You plan to deploy the web app to the North Europe Azure region and the West Europe Azure region.
                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution for the web app. The solution must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Users must always access the web app from the North Europe region, unless the region fails.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë The web app must be available to users if an Azure region is unavailable.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Deployment costs must be minimized.

                    Planned Changes and Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the external storage used by App1 to Azure Storage.
                    <br />
                    Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts.
                    <br />
                    Authentication and Authorization Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
                    <br />
                    Only users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a
                    hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using
                    <br />
                    Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permissions to the network
                    administrators for all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
                    <br />
                    To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that
                    will host the app.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0000300008.png" />
                    <br />
                    RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Resiliency Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    - Fail over automatically.
                    <br />
                    - Minimize I/O latency.
                    <br />
                    App1 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    Security and Compliance Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the

                    Case Study -
                    <br />
                    This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main
                    office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam,
                    <br />
                    Berlin, and Rome.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment
                    <br />
                    The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There
                    are no trust relationships between the forests.
                    <br />
                    Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and
                    computer authentication.
                    <br />
                    Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&amp;D) department only. The R&amp;D
                    department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main
                    office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.
                    <br />
                    All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.
                    <br />
                    An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is
                    used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet
                    information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and
                    the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
                    <br />
                    The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes
                    Software Assurance.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Problem Statements
                    <br />
                    The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many
                    resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years,
                    including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.
                    <br />
                    As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating
                    an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.
                    <br />
                    All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Technical Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Website content must be easily updated from a single point.
                    <br />
                    User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances.
                    <br />
                    Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.
                    <br />
                    Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.
                    <br />
                    Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.
                    <br />
                    Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure
                    App Service.
                    <br />
                    An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the
                    directory synchronization services.
                    <br />
                    In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual
                    machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory.
                    <br />
                    Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not
                    be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Database Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:
                    <br />
                    Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that
                    database administrators can optimize the performance settings.
                    <br />
                    To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are
                    migrated.
                    <br />
                    Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Security Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:
                    <br />
                    Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside
                    the company.
                    <br />
                    Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet
                    link fails.
                    <br />
                    Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com
                    credentials.
                    <br />
                    All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication
                    (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To start the case study -
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Technical Environment
                    <br />
                    The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Business Partnerships
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
                    <br />
                    (Azure AD) guest accounts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: App1 -
                    <br />
                    App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
                    <br />
                    App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
                    <br />
                    App1 has the following data requirements:
                    <br />
                    Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
                    <br />
                    Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
                    <br />
                    App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
                    <br />
                    All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
                    <br />
                    Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: App2 -
                    <br />
                    App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
                    <br />
                    Save files to an Azure Storage account.
                    <br />
                    Replicate files to an on-premises location.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
                    <br />
                    You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
                    <br />
                    Application Development Requirements
                    <br />
                    Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
                    <br />
                    After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
                    <br />
                    The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Identity Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
                    <br />
                    Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
                    <br />
                    The solution must minimize development effort.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Security Requirement -
                    <br />
                    All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.

                        Requirements: Identity Requirements
                        <br />
                        Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access
                        permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë The solution must minimize development effort.
                        <br />
                        Box 1: The Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
                        <br />
                        When should you use access reviews?
                        <br />
                        Too many users in privileged roles: It's a good idea to check how many users have administrative
                        access, how many of them are Global Administrators, and if
                        <br />

                        there are any invited guests or partners that have not been removed after being assigned to do
                        an administrative task. You can recertify the role assignment users in Azure AD roles such as
                        Global Administrators, or Azure resources roles such as User Access Administrator in the Azure
                        AD Privileged Identity

                        <br />
                        Box 2: Access reviews -
                        <br />
                        Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage
                        group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User's access can be
                        reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right people have continued access.

                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Technical Environment
                    <br />
                    The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Business Partnerships
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
                    <br />
                    (Azure AD) guest accounts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: App1 -
                    <br />
                    App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
                    <br />
                    App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
                    <br />
                    App1 has the following data requirements:
                    <br />
                    Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
                    <br />
                    Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
                    <br />
                    App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
                    <br />
                    All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
                    <br />
                    Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: App2 -
                    <br />
                    App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
                    <br />
                    Save files to an Azure Storage account.
                    <br />
                    Replicate files to an on-premises location.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
                    <br />
                    You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
                    <br />
                    Application Development Requirements
                    <br />
                    Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
                    <br />
                    After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
                    <br />
                    The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Identity Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
                    <br />
                    Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
                    <br />
                    The solution must minimize development effort.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Security Requirement -
                    <br />
                    All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.

                    <br />
                    You need to recommend a solution that meets the file storage requirements for App2.
                    <br />
                    What should you deploy to the Azure subscription and the on-premises network? To answer, drag the
                    appropriate services to the correct locations. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not
                    at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
                    <br />

                        Box 2: Azure File Sync -
                        <br />
                        Use Azure File Sync to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping
                        the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync
                        transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol
                        that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS.
                        You can have as many caches as you need across the world.

                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Technical Environment
                    <br />
                    The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Business Partnerships
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
                    <br />
                    (Azure AD) guest accounts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: App1 -
                    <br />
                    App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
                    <br />
                    App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
                    <br />
                    App1 has the following data requirements:
                    <br />
                    Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
                    <br />
                    Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
                    <br />
                    App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
                    <br />
                    All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
                    <br />
                    Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: App2 -
                    <br />
                    App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
                    <br />
                    Save files to an Azure Storage account.
                    <br />
                    Replicate files to an on-premises location.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
                    <br />
                    You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
                    <br />
                    Application Development Requirements
                    <br />
                    Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
                    <br />
                    After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
                    <br />
                    The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Identity Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
                    <br />
                    Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
                    <br />
                    The solution must minimize development effort.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Security Requirement -
                    <br />
                    All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.

                        <br />
                        B, D: GZRS protects against failures. Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your
                        data to another physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages.
                        However, that data is available to be read only if the customer or Microsoft initiates a
                        failover from the primary to secondary region.
                        <br />
                        C: Active geo-replication is designed as a business continuity solution that lets you perform
                        quick disaster recovery of individual databases in case of a regional disaster or a large scale
                        outage. Once geo-replication is set up, you can initiate a geo-failover to a geo-secondary in a
                        different Azure region. The geo-failover is initiated programmatically by the application or
                        manually by the user.

                    Planned Changes and Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the external storage used by App1 to Azure Storage.
                    <br />
                    Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts.
                    <br />
                    Authentication and Authorization Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
                    <br />
                    Only users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a
                    hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using
                    <br />
                    Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permissions to the network
                    administrators for all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
                    <br />
                    To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that
                    will host the app.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0005400008.png" />
                    <br />
                    RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Resiliency Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    - Fail over automatically.
                    <br />
                    - Minimize I/O latency.
                    <br />
                    App1 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    Security and Compliance Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the
                    modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years.
                    <br />
                    On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the
                    data in App1.
                    <br />
                    Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be
                    prevented.
                    <br />
                    All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
                    enabled.
                    <br />
                    App1 must NOT share physical hardware with other workloads.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                        Box 1: SQL Managed Instance -
                        <br />
                        Scenario: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Fail over automatically.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Minimize I/O latency.
                        <br />
                        The auto-failover groups feature allows you to manage the replication and failover of a group of
                        databases on a server or all databases in a managed instance to another region. It is a
                        declarative abstraction on top of the existing active geo-replication feature, designed to
                        simplify deployment and management of geo- replicated databases at scale. You can initiate a
                        geo-failover manually or you can delegate it to the Azure service based on a user-defined
                        policy. The latter option allows you to automatically recover multiple related databases in a
                        secondary region after a catastrophic failure or other unplanned event that results in full or
                        partial loss of the SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance availability in the primary region.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Box 2: Business critical -
                        <br />
                        SQL Managed Instance is available in two service tiers:
                        <br />
                        General purpose: Designed for applications with typical performance and I/O latency
                        requirements.
                        <br />
                        Business critical: Designed for applications with low I/O latency requirements and minimal
                        impact of underlying maintenance operations on the workload.

                    The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a single Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Business Partnerships -
                    <br />
                    Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso
                    applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory
                    <br />
                    (Azure AD) guest accounts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    App1 -
                    <br />
                    App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from
                    Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
                    <br />
                    App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The
                    credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure
                    region.
                    <br />
                    App1 has the following data requirements:
                    <br />
                    Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.
                    <br />
                    Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
                    <br />
                    App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).
                    <br />
                    Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.
                    <br />
                    All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other
                    connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
                    <br />
                    Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from
                    all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    App2 -
                    <br />
                    App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following
                    file storage requirements:
                    <br />
                    Save files to an Azure Storage account.
                    <br />
                    Replicate files to an on-premises location.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
                    <br />
                    You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the
                    application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.
                    <br />
                    Application Development Requirements
                    <br />
                    Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development
                    process must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the
                    new version is used in production.
                    <br />
                    After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production
                    version.
                    <br />
                    The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime
                    of the application.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Identity Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
                    <br />
                    Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions
                    to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests.
                    <br />
                    The solution must minimize development effort.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Security Requirement -
                    <br />
                    All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
                    <br />
                    Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                    credentials must NOT be shared between services.

                        Scenario: Security Requirement -
                        <br />
                        All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
                        <br />
                        Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The
                        credentials must NOT be shared between services.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Box 1: A service principal -
                        <br />
                        A service principal is a type of security principal that identifies an application or service,
                        which is to say, a piece of code rather than a user or group. A service principal's object ID is
                        known as its client ID and acts like its username. The service principal's client secret acts
                        like its password.
                        <br />
                        Note: Authentication with Key Vault works in conjunction with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD),
                        which is responsible for authenticating the identity of any given security principal.
                        <br />
                        A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service, or application that's
                        requesting access to Azure resources. Azure assigns a unique object
                        <br />
                        ID to every security principal.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Box 2: A role assignment -
                        <br />
                        You can provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based
                        access control.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main
                    office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam,
                    <br />
                    Berlin, and Rome.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment
                    <br />
                    The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There
                    are no trust relationships between the forests.
                    <br />
                    Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and
                    computer authentication.
                    <br />
                    Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&amp;D) department only. The R&amp;D
                    department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main
                    office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.
                    <br />
                    All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.
                    <br />
                    An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is
                    used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet
                    information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and
                    the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
                    <br />
                    The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes
                    Software Assurance.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Problem Statements
                    <br />
                    The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many
                    resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years,
                    including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.
                    <br />
                    As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating
                    an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.
                    <br />
                    All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.

                    Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Technical Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Website content must be easily updated from a single point.
                    <br />
                    User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances.
                    <br />
                    Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.
                    <br />
                    Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.
                    <br />
                    Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.
                    <br />
                    Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure
                    App Service.
                    <br />
                    An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the
                    directory synchronization services.
                    <br />
                    In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual
                    machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory.
                    <br />
                    Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not
                    be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Database Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:
                    <br />
                    Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that
                    database administrators can optimize the performance settings.
                    <br />
                    To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are
                    migrated.
                    <br />
                    Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Security Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:
                    <br />
                    Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside
                    the company.
                    <br />
                    Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet
                    link fails.
                    <br />
                    Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com
                    credentials.
                    <br />
                    All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication
                    (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main
                    office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam,
                    <br />
                    Berlin, and Rome.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Active Directory Environment
                    <br />
                    The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There
                    are no trust relationships between the forests.
                    <br />
                    Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and
                    computer authentication.
                    <br />
                    Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&amp;D) department only. The R&amp;D
                    department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Network Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main
                    office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.
                    <br />
                    All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet.
                    <br />
                    An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is
                    used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet
                    information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and
                    the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
                    <br />
                    The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes
                    Software Assurance.
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment: Problem Statements
                    <br />
                    The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many
                    resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years,
                    including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication.
                    <br />
                    As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating
                    an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment.
                    <br />
                    All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.
                    <br />

                    be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.
                    <br />
                    Requirements: Database Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:
                    <br />
                    Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that

                    <br />
                    Requirements: Security Requirements
                    <br />
                    Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:
                    <br />
                    Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside
                    the company.
                    <br />
                    Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet
                    link fails.
                    <br />
                    Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com

                    Case Study -
                    <br />
                    This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
                    <br />
                    At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.

                    <br />
                    The litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named
                    Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage.

                    Planned Changes and Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the external storage used by App1 to Azure Storage.
                    <br />
                    Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts.
                    <br />
                    Authentication and Authorization Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
                    <br />
                    Only users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a
                    hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using
                    <br />
                    Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permissions to the network
                    administrators for all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
                    <br />
                    To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that
                    will host the app.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0007900008.png" />
                    <br />
                    RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Resiliency Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    - Fail over automatically.
                    <br />
                    - Minimize I/O latency.
                    <br />
                    App1 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    Security and Compliance Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the
                    modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years.
                    <br />
                    On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the
                    data in App1.
                    <br />
                    Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be
                    prevented.
                    <br />
                    All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
                    enabled.
                    <br />
                    App1 must NOT share physical hardware with other workloads.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Business Requirements -
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort.
                    <br />
                    Minimize costs.

                        <br />
                        Blob storage now supports the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol. This support provides
                        Linux file system compatibility at object storage scale and prices and enables Linux clients to
                        mount a container in Blob storage from an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) or a computer on-premises.

                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
                    <br />
                    Only users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a
                    hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using
                    <br />
                    Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permissions to the network
                    administrators for all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
                    <br />
                    To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that
                    will host the app.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"

                    Resiliency Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    - Fail over automatically.
                    <br />
                    - Minimize I/O latency.
                    <br />
                    App1 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    Security and Compliance Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the
                    modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years.
                    <br />
                    On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the
                    data in App1.
                    <br />
                    Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be
                    prevented.
                    <br />
                    All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
                    enabled.
                    <br />
                    App1 must NOT share physical hardware with other workloads.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Business Requirements -

                        A: Microsoft peering provides access to Azure public services via public endpoints with public
                        IP addresses, which should not be allowed.
                        <br />
                        B: Azure public peering has been deprecated.
                        <br />
                        C: By default, Service Endpoints are enabled on subnets configured in Azure virtual networks.
                        Endpoints can't be used for traffic from your premises to Azure services.

                    Case Study -
                    <br />
                    This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.

                    subscriptions that are linked to the dev.litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an
                    Enterprise Agreement (EA).
                    <br />
                    The litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named
                    Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage.

                    Planned Changes and Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the external storage used by App1 to Azure Storage.
                    <br />
                    Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts.
                    <br />
                    Authentication and Authorization Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements:
                    <br />
                    Only users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a
                    hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using
                    <br />
                    Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                    <br />
                    The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permissions to the network
                    administrators for all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions.
                    <br />
                    To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that
                    will host the app.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04082/0007900008.png" />
                    <br />
                    RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Resiliency Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    - Fail over automatically.
                    <br />
                    - Minimize I/O latency.
                    <br />
                    App1 must meet the following requirements:
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones.
                    <br />
                    - Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling.
                    <br />
                    - Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail.
                    <br />
                    Security and Compliance Requirements
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements:
                    <br />
                    Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the
                    modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years.
                    <br />
                    On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the
                    data in App1.
                    <br />
                    Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be
                    prevented.
                    <br />
                    All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
                    enabled.
                    <br />
                    App1 must NOT share physical hardware with other workloads.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Business Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Litware identifies the following business requirements:
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort.
                    <br />
                    Minimize costs.
